_never lose your wallet_

[ETHGlobal Cannes Submission]

The first zero-friction, social seed recovery tool for mass crypto adoption, simple, secure, scalable.

### Usage

Simply follow the steps in the interface, you'll need a biometric passport, a seed phrase and some ways of storing shares (friends, cloud, email, ...)

We recommend sending the shares to your friends by sending them the links we provide, they'll be prompted to download an Apple Wallet invite containing the share.

Whenever you need to recover your seed phrase again, gather enough shares, validate your passport again, and you'll be set!
